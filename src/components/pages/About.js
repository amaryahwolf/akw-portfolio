        <p>
          I am an agile and MERN stack software developer. My interests have lent themselves to human analytics as a direct care worker and project lead, and now have a new evolution towards machine analytics.

          I am obsessed with details and solid team work. I find back-end database handling most rewarding with its myriad of rules to follow closely for success. I bring patience, dedication, collaborative skills, and a growth-oriented mindset to every endeavor.

          In our ever-evolving world of technological advancements coupled with global health phenomena, I am motivated and inspired by reading, writing, films, health, and software development.
